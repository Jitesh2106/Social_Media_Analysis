# Social Media Data Analysis
This repository contains code for conducting text analytics on social media data. 

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed social media posts from two celebrities. The goal is to predict the celebrity based on the content of the posts using text analytics and logistic regression. 

## Data Preparation
I collected social media posts from the two celebrities and performed data preparation. This involved cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including tasks like removing special characters, tokenization, and lowercasing.

## Data Visualization
I built visualizations to compare and contrast the posts from the two celebrities. 

## Model Building
The posts were partitioned into train-test subsets, and a logistic regression model was built. The terms from the posts served as predictors, and the target variable was the celebrity. Variable selection was performed to identify relevant terms for prediction.

## Visualizing Model Statistics
We visualized the test statistics for each term's coefficient. This provided insights into the significance of each term in predicting the celebrity.

# Test Set Accuracy: 87.15%
